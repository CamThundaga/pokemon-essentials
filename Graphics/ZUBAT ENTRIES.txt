STACONAN ZUBAT
Preferring total darkness, Staconan Zubat communicate through controlled discharges of static built up in their fur. Scientists say that their language is far more complicated than our own.

STACONAN GOLBAT
Staconan Golbat are far more mischievious than their Kantonian counterparts, often playing pranks and scaring spelunkers for sport. Despite this, they're fairly friendly and just want to have fun.

STACONAN CROBAT
If you stare up at the night sky and see a flash of lightning followed by maniacal laughing, it's most likely a Staconan Crobat courting a mate. Just make sure not to interfere.
