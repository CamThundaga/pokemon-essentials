I want to have a character from my game gift the only Onix to the player, if that's okay.

Pok√©dex Entry:

TELDONAN ONIX
An icy form of Onix that hails from the Crysteel Mountains of the nearby Teldona Region. When injured, they dip their cold bodies in underground lakewater to create a new frozen shell.


TELDONAN STEELIX
Once a Teldonan Onix matures, it developes a metallic crystalline coating. After toughening this new armor by testing itself against the hardest of crystals, it evolves into this behemoth.

I'll send the movelists of both these and the Zubat line with the shinies, as well as the entries for the Zubat line.
