STACONAN SHUPPET:
It follows its trainer wherever they go, singing and humming happily. Wild Staconan Shuppet will find people to sing to, ringing their bells to impress them. When alone, they cry loudly.

STACONAN BANETTE:
Staconan Banette are some of the most happy and loving Pokémon, and you'll often see them playing with their trainers. They're happy to share the love with others as well, but if it senses hostility against its trainer, it will attack with deadly force. If they are separated from the person they care about, their cries can be heard for miles.
